Ben's Pizzeria - Project Overview

Stock Control Requirements
The owner wants to know whenit’s time to order new stock.
To achieve this we need more information about:
            - what ingredients go into each pizza
            - ingredient quantity based on pizza size
            - existing stock level
We’ll assume the lead time for delivery by suppliers is the same for all ingredients.

Based on staff salary information, how much does each pizza cost (ingredients + chefs + delivery)
